Step-by-Step Guide on how to send Windows Logs to google SecOps SIEM solution

First, Set up Windows Event Forwarding:
To transmit logs to a central log collector, turn on Windows Event Forwarding on your Windows computer. Creating a subscription on the Windows computer and designating the log collector as the destination will allow you to accomplish this.

Second, Set up a Log Collector and Install It:
Install on a Linux computer a log collector such as Google's BindPlane. Set up the log collector to transmit logs to the Google SecOps SIEM after receiving them from the Windows computer.

Set Up BindPlane to Send Logs to Google SecOps SIEM:
Change the config.yaml file to set BindPlane up to transmit logs to Google SecOps SIEM. The Google SecOps SIEM endpoint and authentication information must be specified.

config.yaml - output:
  google_secops_siem:
    endpoint: "https://your-siem-endpoint.com"
    auth:
      username: "your-username"
      password: "your-password"

Interpret and Modify Records:
To parse and convert the Windows logs into a format that is compatible with Google SecOps SIEM, use a log parsing and transformation tool such as Logstash.

input {
  tcp {
    host => "your-log-collector-ip"
    port => 514
  }
}

filter {
  # Parse Windows logs
  grok {
    match => {
      "message" => [
        "%{NUMBER:when}\\s+\\d+\\s%{SYSLOGHOST:srcip} %{WORD:action}\\/%{NUMBER:returnCode} %{NUMBER:size} %{WORD:method} (?P<url>\\S+) (?P<username>.*?) %{WORD}\\/(?P<tgtip>\\S+).*"
      ]
    }
    overwrite => ["when","srcip","action","returnCode","size","method","url","username","tgtip"]
    on_error => "not_valid_log"
  }

  # Transform and save logs
  mutate {
    rename => {
      "when" => "timestamp"
      "url" => "event.idm.read_only_udm.target.url"
      "returnCode" => "event.idm.read_only_udm.network.http.response_code"
      "size" => "event.idm.read_only_udm.network.received_bytes"
    }
  }
}

output {
  google_secops_siem {
    endpoint => "https://your-siem-endpoint.com"
    auth => {
      username => "your-username"
      password => "your-password"
    }
  }
}

Finally, Execute and Verify:
Install the Logstash settings and verify that Windows logs are properly transported to Google SecOps SIEM by running a log forwarding test.
